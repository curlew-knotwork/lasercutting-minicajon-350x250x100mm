# STATUS
- Status = work in progress (18.12.2025)

# NOTES
- 6mm thick plywood bottom and sides
- 3mm thick plywood top tapa
- You have to cut 20x20x94mm triangular corner dowels separately.
  Leave the top 50mm (nearest the tapa inner face) unglued to sides, for better sound and resonance.
  It lets the tapa vibrate and flex more.
  Adjust the screw tension or tapa to the dowels appropriately for the sound you want.
- You have to adjust the snare bar placement for the individual cajon and snare used.
- The box needs to be airtight, so the fingerjoints are glued.
- Edges should be sanded, also the sound hole for smoother airflow.
- The tapa is only screwed on, not glued.
- The snare should just be gently brushing the bottom of the tapa. You may need to
  adjust the snare attached to snare bar. Snare bar is screwed into the high end
  of the snare bar (15mm away) nearest from the inner tapa face. You can attach the tapa with a few
  screw while adjusting the sound of the snare.
- The snare bar has 15x6mm tabs and should fit into the 6.2x15.2mm slots cut into the 100x350 mm faces.
  You need to eventually glue in so that the inner cavity is air tight.
- Adjust the tapa screws all around to get the sound you want, and areas of different sound.
